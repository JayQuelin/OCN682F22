### Question 1

*  Draw a concepts diagram that uses all the following R and programming terminology 
   * Include any missing keywords that will simplify the concepts diagrams 


`Code`, `Variable`, `Data`, `Function`, `Call`, `Invoke`, `Type`, `Expression`, `Assign`, `Return value`, `Character`, `Numeric`, `Integer`, `Logical`, `Data structure`, `Arguments`, `Parameters`, `Default values`, `Vector`, `Data Type`, `Statement`, `Comment`

### Question 2

* Rename this notebook to `Practical_1`

* Make sure the notebook is set to use the `R` Kernel (instead of python by default)
  * This is called the `runtime`

* Test the runtime to make sure everything works, use the cell below to instantiate a vector `x` with any 5 values and computing its mean.
  * The mean function can be invoked using `mean` and passing it `x`
  * Assign the returned value to a variable called `y`

* Create a cell above the current one and describe the computation that you just did
  * A title that reads: "This is a markdown test"
  * Text that reads: "the variable y contains the mean of 5 values."
  * Try to format (emphasize) the name `x` so it stands out.


```{r}
# Write you code in this cell
# I am in RStudio for now. 
#This is a markdown test. 

x <- c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55)
y <- mean (x) #The variable y contains the mean of five values. 
```

### Question 3

In cell below:
* Crate a statement that assigns to a variable `sec_per_min` the number of seconds in each minute
* Use the variable `sec_per_min` to compute a new variable called `sec_per_hour` representing the number of seconds per hour
  * `sec_per_hour` is simply the number of `sec_per_min` multilied by 60.
* Use the variable `sec_per_hour` to compute a variable called `sec_per_day` representing the number of seconds per day
  * `sec_per_day` is simply the numebr of `sec_per_hour` multilied by 24.

* Use an expression to show the calculated value; i.e., the number of seconds in a single day.

```{r}
# Write you code in this cell
sec_per_min <- 60
sec_per_hour <- sec_per_min * 60
sec_per_day <- sec_per_hour * 24

```

### Question 4

* Recall that `c` creates atomic vectors

* What does the following create? 
  * Specifically, what is the of the data it contains?

`c(1, 2, 3, "Hi")`# This creates a character string

* Would the following be valid?

`c(1, 2, 3, "Hi") + 1 # No, 1 cannot be added to the character string`

* How about 

`c(1, 2, 3, FALSE) + 1 `# Yes because FALSE is also = 0, so adding one will create a numeric vector.


### Question 5: 

* We will be reproducing the following plot
```{r}
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4nf3n96np3i7nm/simple_qplot_example.png?dl=1)
```

### Create `x-axis` values

* Create a variable called `x_axis` that is a `vector` of numerical values between 0 and 10 with a step of 0.5. 
    * i.e., `x_axis` will contain the values 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 .... 10
    * Hint: you need a function that returns a sequence of values as a vector

```{r}
# Write you code in this cell
x_axis <- seq(0, 10, .5)
```

### Create `y-axis` values

* Create a variable called `y_axis` that is a list of $x^2 + 2x + 3 $. 
* I.e., each position in `y_axis` is computed as $x^2 + 2x + 3 $, x is the value at the same position in `x_axis`
* For example: 
  * The value at the first position of `y_axis` is 0^2 + 2*0 + 3 = 3
  * The value at the second position of `y_axis` is 0.5^2 + 2*0.5 + 3 = 4.25
  * etc...
* Hint: remember that arithmetic operations on a vector are evaluated element-wise

```{r}
# Write you code in this cell
y_axis <- x_axis^2 + 2*x_axis + 3
  
```

### Generate the plot of `x_axis` versus `y_axis`

* Plot the values of `x_axis` and `y_axis`
* Use the `qplot` function, which is part of `ggplot` library to plot the `x_axis` and `y_axis`.
    * You can consult `qplot`'s documentation to see what arguments it takes as input
 
* Change the behavior of your plot so that it has:
  * A label for the `x-axis`. Mine says "My  x_axis"
  * A label for the `y-axis`. Mine says "My  x_axis"
  * A title. Mine says "My amazing plot of x_axis versus y_axis"  
  * Dots that are bigger than those produced by default.
 
* Hint: We know that we can change the default behavior of a function by changing the default parameters.
  * Which default parameter (param) controls the `x-axis`, `y-axis`, and plot labels?
  * Which default parameter controls the size of the symbol (dot here)?

```{r}
# Write you code in this cell
qplot(x_axis, y_axis, size = 19, main = "My amazing plot of x_axis versus y_axis", xlab= "My x_axis", ylab= "My y_axis")
```
